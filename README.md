# SonarDetectionSystem
 <img src="media/demo.PNG" width="300">
This project came from a video I had seen on Tiktok. A simple and short video showing off an Arduino build consisting ofthe sonar sensor, mounted on top of a servo moter, making it turn back and forth while the person placed objects infront and on the computer behind the objects were rendered in the screen in a program. I have a class worth of experience of Arduino and had a kit at home so with a little cardboard, tape, and a friend, I created what I call a masterpiece... But not really, while this all looks impressive, the libraries for arduino to java were really well made that made the entire project work. Everything apart of this project kind of came together really well, for some reason I encountered zero interruptions and got all this done in one night and non big bugs that stumped me at all, suspiciously worked too well. Typically people will value things that they have spent time on, think a car someone has worked on for a really long time, they dont want to let it go. I only spent one night, and i had to get some tutoring on how these things worked from a friend who also supplied a line of code or two.

This is a video(not really well made) showing off what it looked like.

This is another video, not much is explained but a simple sonar detector.
